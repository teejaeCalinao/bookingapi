// [Section] JSON Web Tokens
/*
- JSON Web Token or JWT is a way of securely passing information from the server to the client or to other parts of a server
- Information is kept secure through the use of the secret code
- Only the system that knows the secret code that can decode the encrypted information
- Imagine JWT as a gift wrapping service that secures the gift with a lock
- Only the person who knows the secret code can open the lock
- And if the wrapper has been tampered with, JWT also recognizes this and disregards the gift
- This ensures that the data is secure from the sender to the receiver
